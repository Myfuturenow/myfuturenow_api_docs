The MyFutureNow API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.
